				<p class="paragraph">One day the little red hen found some seeds on the ground. 
				The little red hen had an idea. She would plant the seeds.<br />

				The little red hen asked her friends, 
				"Who will help me plant the seeds?"<br /><br />

				"Not I," barked the lazy dog.<br />
				"Not I," purred the sleepy cat. <br />
				"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.<br /><br />

				"Then I will," said the little red hen. 
				So the little red hen planted the seeds all by herself.

				<p class="paragraph">When the seeds had grown, the little red hen asked her friends, 
				"Who will help me cut the wheat?"<br /><br />

				"Not I," barked the lazy dog. <br />
				"Not I," purred the sleepy cat.<br />
				"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.<br /><br />

				"Then I will," said the little red hen. 
				So the little red hen cut the wheat all by herself.

				<p class="paragraph">When all the wheat was cut, the little red hen asked her friends,
			 	"Who will help me take the wheat to the mill to be ground into flour?"<br /><br />

				"Not I," barked the lazy dog.<br />
				"Not I," purred the sleepy cat.<br />
				"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.<br /><br />

				"Then I will," said the little red hen. <br /><br />
				So the little red hen brought the wheat to the mill all by herself, 
				ground the wheat into flour, and carried the heavy sack of flour back to the farm.

				"Not I," barked the lazy dog.<br />
				"Not I," purred the sleepy cat. <br />
				"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.<br /><br />

				<p class="paragraph">When the bread was finished, the tired little red hen asked her friends, 
				"Who will help me eat the bread?"<br /><br />

				"I will," barked the lazy dog. <br />
				"I will," purred the sleepy cat.<br />
				"I will," quacked the noisy yellow duck.<br /><br />

				"No!" said the little red hen. "I will." And the little red hen ate the bread all by herself.</p>
